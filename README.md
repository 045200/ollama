## Getting Started

Ollama App has a pretty simple and intuitive interface to be as open as possible. Everything just works out of the but, you just have to follow the two next steps.

### Installation

You'll find the latest recommended version of the Ollama App under [the releases tab](https://github.com/JHubi1/ollama-app/releases). Download the APK and install it on your Android device. That's it, now proceed to [Initial Setup](#initial-setup).

Alternatively, you can also download the app from any of the following stores:

### Setup

The most difficult part is setting up the host. To learn more visit the [wiki guide on how to do so](https://github.com/JHubi1/ollama-app/wiki/Getting-Started#setting-up-the-host). After setting up, you normally don't have to enter it again.

And you're done! Just start chatting with your local AI and have fun!

> [!TIP]
> The new Voice Mode is now avaliable as an experimental feature. Learn more about it in [the documentation](https://github.com/JHubi1/ollama-app/wiki/Components#voice).
